# Coding Challenging Quiz
Created by Siddharth Desai

## Description

The reasoning behind this project was to create a daily planner to help keep track of daily tasks. The design is using hour time blocks with the ability to clear the time block text via the clear button. The user is able to save their input text via the save button and the data is still present upon refreshing the page. In addition, the user is able to see the current time with a red background, past time slots in gray, and future time slots in green.

This project helped continue my knowledge in dynamically creating html/css elements through Jquery and javascript. In addition I learned how to use Moment.js to keep track of the current time and leveraging bootstrap to create a user friendly webpage.
